	<h2>Technical Logistics of the Attack<br></h2>
        Vulnerability Exploited: CVE-2017-5638<br>
        The breach originated from CVE-2017-5638, a critical vulnerability in the Apache Struts 2 framework, specifically within its Jakarta Multipart parser used to handle file uploads. This flaw allowed remote code execution (RCE) through crafted HTTP requests containing malicious Content-Type headers.<br>
		<ul>
        <li>Severity: CVSS score of 10.0 (critical)<br></li>
        <li>Disclosure Date: March 6, 2017<br></li>
        <li>Patch Released: Same day by the Apache Software Foundation<br></li>
		</ul>
    
    <h2>Equifax’s Failure to Patch<br></h2>
        Despite receiving alerts from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and internal security directives, Equifax failed to identify and patch all vulnerable systems. A critical web application tied to Equifax's consumer dispute portal remained unpatched and publicly accessible.<br>
		   <ul>
		   <li>March 7, 2017: DHS issues public warning<br></li>
           <li>March 8, 2017: Equifax security team is notified<br></li>
           <li>March 10, 2017: Attackers begin exploiting the vulnerability<br></li>
		   </ul>
        This oversight exposed Equifax to active exploitation for over two months.<br>
    
    <h2>Timeline of Exploitation<br></h2>
        May 13 – July 30, 2017: Attackers maintained persistent access to Equifax’s network<br>
		<br>
        Data Exfiltrated: Names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, driver's license numbers, and credit card information<br>
        Attackers used web shells and performed lateral movement within the network to escalate access<br>
        Exfiltration was performed in small, encrypted batches to avoid detection<br>
    
    <h2>Operational Tactics<br></h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Use of 40+ IP addresses across various countries<br></li>
    <li>Deployment of encrypted communication channels<br></li>
    <li>Use of anti-forensic techniques, such as log deletion<br></li>
    <li>Highly targeted, disciplined data exfiltration strategy indicative of nation-state actors<br> 
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion<br></h2>
        The Equifax breach was caused by a failure to patch a known, critical vulnerability—CVE-2017-5638—despite multiple warnings and available fixes. 
		The attack was executed by sophisticated state-sponsored actors from the Chinese military, whose objective was strategic data acquisition rather than immediate monetary gain.<br>
        This incident underscores the catastrophic risk of poor patch management, especially in critical infrastructure, and serves as a landmark case linking cybersecurity negligence to national security threats.<br>

    <p>Technical Logistics of the Attack<br>
    </p><br>
    <p>Vulnerability Exploited: CVE-2017-5638<br>
        The breach originated from CVE-2017-5638, a critical vulnerability in the Apache Struts 2 framework, specifically within its Jakarta Multipart parser used to handle file uploads. This flaw allowed remote code execution (RCE) through crafted HTTP requests containing malicious Content-Type headers.<br>
        Severity: CVSS score of 10.0 (critical)<br>
        Disclosure Date: March 6, 2017<br>
        Patch Released: Same day by the Apache Software Foundation<br>
    </p><br>
    <p>Equifax’s Failure to Patch<br>
        Despite receiving alerts from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and internal security directives, Equifax failed to identify and patch all vulnerable systems. A critical web application tied to Equifax's consumer dispute portal remained unpatched and publicly accessible.<br>
        March 7, 2017: DHS issues public warning<br>
        March 8, 2017: Equifax security team is notified<br>
        March 10, 2017: Attackers begin exploiting the vulnerability<br>
        This oversight exposed Equifax to active exploitation for over two months.<br>  
    </p><br>
    <p>Timeline of Exploitation<br>
        May 13 – July 30, 2017: Attackers maintained persistent access to Equifax’s network<br>
        Data Exfiltrated: Names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, driver's license numbers, and credit card information<br>
        Attackers used web shells and performed lateral movement within the network to escalate access<br>
        Exfiltration was performed in small, encrypted batches to avoid detection<br>

    <h2>What Happened?<br></h2>
         In 2017, Equifax—one of the three major U.S. credit reporting agencies—suffered a massive data breach after hackers exploited a known vulnerability in its web application software.<br> 
         The breach occurred between May and July 2017, but was not disclosed until September.
    
    
    <h2>What Was Compromised?<br></h2>
         The personal data of 147.9 million Americans, along with tens of millions of British and Canadian citizens, was exposed. The stolen information included:<br>
            <ul>
			<li>Full names</li>
			<li>Social Security numbers</li>
			<li>Birth dates</li>
			<li>Addresses</li>
			<li>Driver’s license numbers</li>
			<li>Around 209,000 credit card numbers</li>
			</ul>        
    
    <h2>Consequences<br></h2>
         Legal & Financial: Equifax reached a settlement of up to $700 million with the U.S. government, including $425 million for consumer compensation.<br>
         Leadership Changes: Several executives resigned, including the CEO.<br>
         Public Backlash: Equifax was heavily criticized for poor security, a slow response, and unclear communication.<br>
         Lasting Impact: Public trust in data handlers declined sharply, and the breach became a driving force in discussions about stricter data privacy laws.    
    
   
    <h2>Security and Industry Impact<br></h2>
         Equifax invested $1.6 billion to improve its cybersecurity.<br>
         The breach emphasized the urgent need for better data protection and spurred proposed privacy regulations in the U.S.

    <p>Mitigation Tactics and Recommendations for Building In-Depth Defenses into IT Systems<br>
        1. Limit Sensitive Data Stored in the Systems<br>
        Organizations should apply the principle of data minimization, only collecting and retaining the data that is essential for business operations. This reduces the impact of a breach and minimizes the scope of data at risk. Key strategies include:<br>
        Classifying data based on sensitivity.<br>
        Automatically purging or archiving stale data.<br>
        Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit.<br>
        Applying strict access controls and user privileges.<br>
        2. Embed Security into Software Design and Development<br>
        Security must be integrated from the earliest stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) â€” often called "shift-left" security. Recommendations include:<br>
        Conducting threat modeling during the design phase.<br>
        Enforcing secure coding practices and using code scanning tools (e.g., SAST/DAST).<br>
        Regularly performing code reviews and penetration testing.<br>
        Including security checks in CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities before deployment.<br>
        3. Protect Systems in Operation from Attacks<br>
        Operational systems must be hardened against threats through continuous protection and monitoring:<br>
        Patch management programs must ensure timely updates of software and libraries.<br>
        Network segmentation should be used to contain breaches.<br>
        Endpoint protection platforms (EPP) and firewalls must be configured correctly.<br>
        Implement multifactor authentication (MFA) and strict identity management controls.<br>
        4. Identify Attacks and Block Their Spread<br>
        Detection and containment are crucial for limiting the scope of a cyberattack:<br>
        Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to detect anomalies.<br>
        Use behavior analytics to identify lateral movement or privilege escalation.<br>
        Define and rehearse incident response playbooks.<br>
        Employ network micro-segmentation and zero trust architecture to contain threats.<br>
